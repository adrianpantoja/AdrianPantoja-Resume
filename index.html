        <p class="lead mb-4">I have experience working with the Upward Bound Program, which provided me with 3 different internships that fueled my interest in marketing. The first internship was a Journalism internship. Through this internship, I was able to interview High School seniors in the program and their experiences with the services that the program offers, such as tutoring and electives. I was involved in the process of filming and editing the interviews, as well as uploading them to the program's YouTube channel. I was also involved in taking b-roll and photographing events happening throughout the time I was there. This internship helped me explore my interest in digital marketing, and it opened up a path towards future internships that I would be taking place in. Overall, this internship was a great beginning to my path in marketing. <br><br>

        My second internship was Digital Marketing. This internship provdied me with a lot of knowledge of how to create informational flyers that would benefit particular groups of people. My main task was to create a workbook for 4th graders on the topic of Astronomy. I designed a 40-page workbook that would be printed and handed out to kids in 4th grade. This helped me improve my design skills and I was able to work with the website Canva on a professional level. The experience that this internship gave me opened up many paths for me, which include being part of clubs and officer positions that required digital marketing experience. My photoshop skills were also improved as I got to work with Adobe and learned many skills that will be useful towards my future jobs and clubs. To this day, I still use said skills in the Marketing Committee that I am in, from creating a slideshow about me, to designing posts for the club's social media.<br><br>

        Lastly, my third internship included studying marketing trends. This was an entire different aspect to marketin that I was not thinking of before. It did not include just design, but studying previous marketing trends so that I could cater my product towards new generations. At first, this was something I was not very interested it, but later on I accepted that it could be a part of my job and I started to like the topic. My main task included designing my own pair of shoes using marketing trends. I had to study previous marketing trends to decide which shoes would be most loved today, and which would not. My shoes ended up looking very modern and stylish, targeted towards teenagers and young adults. I figured that it is shoes like those that sell the most nowadayas. All in all, this internship taught me how to use marketing trends to promote my products and helped me expand my design skills.
